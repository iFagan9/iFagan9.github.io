                    My name is Ian Fagan and I am currently a third year game development student at Miami University. I was originally born in Cleveland, Ohio but I have spent most of my life growing up in Phoenix, Arizona.

                <p class="abouttext">
                    I love developing games and messing around with problems in code. I mostly work in 2D because of my bad modeling skills but would still love to work in 3D. I also enjoy watching videos about specific math topics and creating a simulation in code of them.
